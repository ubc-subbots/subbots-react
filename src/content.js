      blurb: "UBC Subbots is an engineering student design team dedicated to " 
              +"making an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for the RoboSub competition "
              +"in San Diego, California each year. This competition challenges us to make "
              +"a robot that can navigate and interact with underwater obstacles without any "
              +"human intervention whatsoever. The team was founded in 2017 and is made up of "
              +"engineering and computer science students from multiple disciplines who have full "
              +"control over the design, manufacturing and testing of the robot. Since becoming "
              +"a team, we have learned a lot about designing for the underwater environment and "
              +"are continuously improving upon our existing designs. ",

      body: " Subbots provides the chance for students to work on unique design "
                +"problems that can’t be found anywhere else at UBC. The team originated from "
                +"two existing designs teams: UBC SUBC who focuses on the design of human powered "
                +"submarines, and UBC Snowbots who designs autonomous land robots for various "
                +"applications. Combining these two together brings a variety of challenges such "
                +"as autonomous underwater navigation, hydrodynamics and buoyancy, electronics "
                +"waterproofing, actuation of mechanical systems and many more. Since Subbots is a "
                +"relatively new design team, there is plenty of opportunity to improve upon existing"
                +" designs, and be a part of building the team. This means that even as new members, "
                +"your work is significant and directly related to the success of our robot!"

                +"way for students to take what they have learned in the classroom and apply it to "
                +"real world problems. We do our best to inspire interest in subsea and robotic "
                +"design while maintaining a fun atmosphere that promotes learning and team bonding.  "
                +"Even when components can be purchased off the shelf, we build most of our components from "
                +"the ground up for maximum learning experience. This enables each member of the team to  "
                +"understand all aspects of the design, and further improve their technical skills. "
                +"Each year we hope to grow as a team by recruiting motivated and hard working students  "
                +"who share a passion for our project. \n\n On the technical side, our team's goal is to "
                +"build a robot that is capable of competing in the RoboSub competition each year. To  "
                +"do this our members must learn how to work within a team and multidisciplinary  "
                +"environment to tackle unique design challenges. The team's goal is to facilitate  "
                +"learning in all aspects of AUV design and encourage good engineering practices that  "
